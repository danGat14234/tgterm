# Development rules

- We don't add any dependency if possible. Ask the user if there is to add a dependency.
- Don't accept speed improvements that are just marginal, like 1%: they may be just random fluctations among runs. Refuse small speed improvements especially if they make the code more complicated, however more complex code for important speed improvements is ok.
- Always test a code modification after committing it. Don't assume things work.
- Once you reach a positive result, commit it.
- Never add or commit unstaged files, unless you created them for a specific purpose.
- Code must be simple and understandable.
- No dead code must be left around.
- Stick to standard C, no compiler-specific tricks, pragmas, ...
